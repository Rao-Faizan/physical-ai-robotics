# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** course! Master the future of embodied intelligence - from ROS 2 to NVIDIA Isaac.

## 🎯 Course Overview

![Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics](/img/ai-1.png)

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This comprehensive course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

:::tip Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.
